# shop-circuit
[Submission](https://devpost.com/software/shop-circuit) for UofTHacks VII

## Inspiration
When we go grocery shopping, it's difficult to find the items we need and end up wandering in circles. As busy CS students, it is important that we don't waste time so finding the most effective route around a grocery store would be beneficial to us.

## What it does
With our app, you can create a layout of your grocery store, assigning the entrance, exit, and shelves that are labeled categorically. Then you can create your grocery list, and generate an efficient path that will take you to all the items you need.

## What we used
We built the application using Java, XML, and SQLite in Android Studio.
